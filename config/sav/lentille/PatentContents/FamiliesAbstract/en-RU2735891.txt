FIELD: medicine.SUBSTANCE: injector of the flexible intraocular lens comprises a tubular main portion comprising a body, a stem, barrel having a cross-section decreasing in the opposite direction relative to the tubular main part, and separation in the axial cavity of the tubular main part, intended for reception of a shuttle storage unit containing a flexible intraocular lens, wherein the tubular main body has a side opening, in order to enable the introduction of the shuttle storage unit, wherein near this side opening the housing comprises a first outwardly projecting rotary connecting means, capable of engaging with second rotary connecting means provided on shuttle storage unit, so that when two rotary connecting means are engaged, shuttle storage unit can rotate about axis parallel to axial direction of axial cavity of tubular main part. Tubular storage unit for an injector of a flexible intraocular lens comprises a body with a cavity for receiving a flexible intraocular lens, outlet opening, intended in said second position of shuttle storage unit, to provide communication between cavity of shuttle unit and discharge cavity of barrel, and an inlet opening, in the above second position of the shuttle storage unit, to provide communication between the shuttle unit cavity and the tubular main part axial cavity, in which rod is located. At that, on the shuttle unit housing there is an outward projecting second rotary connecting device, made with possibility of interaction with the first rotary connecting facility located on the body of the tubular main part. Injector assembly comprises injector and shuttle storage unit. Sterile container comprises a shuttle storage unit and has a shuttle unit retention portion on which the shuttle unit body is retained, and receiving section for receiving tubular main part of injector equipped with barrel, that in the position of the tubular main part introduction into the receiving section its first rotary connecting device interacted with the said rotary connecting device of the shuttle storage unit, thus providing shuttle storage unit withdrawal from sterile container.EFFECT: use of this group of inventions enables to withdraw a shuttle storage unit containing a lens from a sterile container, pre-loaded in a non-stressed state and loaded into the main part of the device quickly and easily and without risk of contamination or damage of the outlet tip (or barrel) of the device.15 cl, 8 dwg
