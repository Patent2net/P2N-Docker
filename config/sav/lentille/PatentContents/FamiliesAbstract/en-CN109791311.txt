The invention relates to an ophthalmic lens (1) for a pair of sunglasses, said ophthalmic lens including at least one substrate (13), the lens (1) having a transmission spectrum such that: the transmittance at wavelengths shorter than 380 nm is lower than 1%; the spectrum includes a first transmittance maximum (MAX-1) having a transmittance higher than 8% between 390 nm and 420 nm; the spectrum includes a first transmittance minimum (MIN-1) between 426 nm and 440 nm the transmittance between 450 nm and 500 nm is higher than 10%; the spectrum includes between 570 nm and 595 nm a second transmittance minimum (MIN-2); the spectrum includes between 590 nm and 620 nm a second transmittance maximum (MAX-2); the spectrum includes in the wavelength range comprised between 620 nm and 640 nm a thirdtransmittance minimum (MIN-3); the transmittance at wavelengths longer than 640 nm is higher than 14%.
