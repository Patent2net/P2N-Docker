1372816 Grinding lenses ESSILOR INTERNATIONAL CIE GENERALE D'OPTIQUE 18 May 1973 18 May 1972 23870/73 Heading B3D A method of working the peripheral portion 14 of a flexible contact lens 10 comprises gripping the lens between a pair of coaxial rotary spindles 11, 12, rotating the spindles, and bring- ing a working surface 16 into contact with the lens until there is deformation of the peripheral portion of the blank whereby the opposed faces A, B of the lens are alternately worked. When moulded, the lens initially has an angular edge 13 which it is desired to machine to a rounded configuration. The lens is mounted between the spindles 11, 12, one of which is driven, and an abrasive surface 16 on a support 15 is arranged so that a normal N to the surface lies in the median of the plane of the periphery of the lens and the support is moved in a direction D parallel to the normal until the peripheral position of the lens deforms. During rotation of the lens, the deformation alternately reverses itself, as shown in Fig. 3, to round the edge of the lens. The method is repeated using finer abrasive and polishing is effected using a surface of pitch and pulverulent abrasive material.
