The invention relates to a lens that can be implanted in the cornea for correcting vision defects, such as presbyopia. It consists of a zonal diffractive lens with phase inversion that comprises an alternation of optically active or &ldquo;full&rdquo; annular areas (2) and of optically inactive or empty annular areas (3) which are all concentric. The empty annular areas (3) are filled with an optically inactive &ldquo;cement&rdquo; that binds together the &ldquo;full&rdquo; annular areas (2) in order to ensure the stability thereof. The cement is a hydrogel pervious to nutrients and oxygen having an optical index close to that of the cornea.
