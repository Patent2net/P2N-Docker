PURPOSE:To provide a bulk chip type electronic parts feeder associated with a machine for automatically mounting chip type electronic components onto a circuit board in which a problem of deficient supply of chip type electronic parts to a super high speed automatic electronic component mounting machine and a problem of cost reduction are solved. CONSTITUTION:A guide groove 17 is made around a storage chamber 13 for chip type electronic component 14 which is fed from a chip type electronic component feeding section 22 disposed above the storage chamber 13 thus dealing with a super high speed mounting machine having remarkably high supply amount.
