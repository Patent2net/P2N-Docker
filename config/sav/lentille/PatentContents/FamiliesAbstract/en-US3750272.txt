A method for machining contact lenses of flexible material such as silicone. The lens is centered on two rotary spindles of which one is a driving spindle and is clamped therebetween. An annular supporting member having a surface with the same curvature as the face of the lens maintains the shape of the flexible lens during rotation of the lens until it is hardened by the spraying of a jet of cooling fluid which may be liquid nitrogen or liquid air. The spraying of the lens continues while the diameter is reduced, if such reduction is necessary. The supporting member is then removed and the peripheral edge of the lens is machined.
