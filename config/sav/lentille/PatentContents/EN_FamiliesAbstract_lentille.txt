PURPOSE:To make it possible to positive-negative symmetric coil current only by a unipolar electric power source by switching alternate terminals at both sides of a series circuit of a driving coil and capacitor from a positive potential to zero. CONSTITUTION:With switches S5 and S4 closed, capacitor C is charged and capacitor voltage Vc and coil voltage Vs1 of the switch S1 side increase from zero to +Vo. After initial charging, switches S5 and S4 are opened while switches S2 and S3 are closed. As a result, voltage Vs2 at the coupling point between switches S3 and S4 changes to +V1 and voltage Vs1 drops to OV; and voltage Vc increases to +(V0+V1) and Vc loses V1 due to a revolution loss to reach -V0 a half period later. For the purpose, switches S2 and S3 are opened and S1 and S4 are closed a half period later to set voltage Vs2 to OV and Vs1 to +V1 and consequently, voltage Vc changes to -(Vo+V1) and then approximates to +Vo a half cycle later. As a result, voltage Vc-Vs1 applied to driving coil L has the same waveform with voltage Vc at any time, so that it will be symmetrical between the positive and negative.

A method for machining contact lenses of flexible material such as silicone. The lens is centered on two rotary spindles of which one is a driving spindle and is clamped therebetween. An annular supporting member having a surface with the same curvature as the face of the lens maintains the shape of the flexible lens during rotation of the lens until it is hardened by the spraying of a jet of cooling fluid which may be liquid nitrogen or liquid air. The spraying of the lens continues while the diameter is reduced, if such reduction is necessary. The supporting member is then removed and the peripheral edge of the lens is machined.

A method for machining the peripheral portion of flexible contact lenses. A flexible contact lens blank is gripped between a pair of aligned rotary spindles which are then set in rotation. The actual machining is effected by a working surface which is preferably planar and covered with an abrasive material corresponding to the type of working treatment the contact lens blank is to undergo. The working surface is brought into contact with the angular peripheral edge of the lens blank until there is deformation of the peripheral portion of the lens blank. By holding the working surface in position relative to the lens blank being worked, the faces of the blank at the periphery are automatically alternately and successively worked.
