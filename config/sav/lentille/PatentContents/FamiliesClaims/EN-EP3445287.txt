2. Injection device according to claim 1, wherein the casing (2) of the tubular body (1) carries, as a first rotating fixing means, a hollow cylinder which presents a longitudinal axis parallel to said axial direction (4), and where a rod provided on the storage container (9) can be sunken, as a second rotating fixing means.
3. Injection device according to claim 1, wherein the casing (2) of the tubular body (1) carries, as a first rotating fixing means, a rod (11) axially parallel to said axial direction (4), and about which a hollow cylinder (12) provided on the storage container (9) can be sunken, as a second rotating fixing means.
4. Injection device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the housing (8) in the axial cavity of the tubular body (1) presents first snap-fitting means (17), capable of engaging with second snap-fitting means (16) provided on the storage container (9) so as to block the storage container (9) in its abovesaid second position.
5. Storage container (9) for soft intraocular lens injection device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that it comprises
- a container body (13) presenting a container cavity intended to receive a soft intraocular lens (10),
- an outlet opening (14), which is intended, in the abovesaid second position of the storage container (9), to make it possible for a communication between the container cavity and the ejection cavity of the barrel (7), and
- an inlet opening (15), which is intended, in the abovesaid second position of the storage container (9), to make it possible for a communication between the container cavity and the axial cavity of the tubular body (1) wherein said pushbutton (3) is located, and
in that the container body (13) carries, protruding externally, said second rotating fixing means (12), capable of engaging with said first rotating fixing element (11) carried by the casing (2) of the tubular body (1).
6. Storage container (9) according to claim 5, characterised in that the container body (13) carries externally, said second snap-fitting means (16), capable of engaging with said first snap-fitting means (17) of the housing (8) of the tubular body (1) of the injection device according to claim 4, to block the storage container (9) in its abovesaid second position.
7. Storage container (9) according to either of claims 5 and 6, characterised in that it presents a gripping means (18) to grip to actuate said rotation of the storage container (9) between its first position and its second position.
8. Injection assembly comprising an injection device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 and a storage container (9) according to any one of claims 5 to 7.
9. Sterile vessel (19) comprising a storage container (9) according to any one of claims 5 to 7.
10. Sterile vessel (19) according to the preceding claim, characterised in that the sterile vessel (19) is provided with a blockable opening (20).
11. Sterile vessel (19) according to claim 10, characterised in that the sterile vessel (19) presents a portion for retaining the container (21), wherein the container body (13) is maintained with the inlet opening (15) of the storage container (9) and said second rotating fixing means (12) of it, oriented towards the blockable opening (20) of the vessel (19), and a sinking portion (24) intended to receive the tubular body (1) of the injection device, equipped with its barrel (7), such that, in the sinking position of said tubular body (1) in this sinking portion (24), said first rotating fixing means (11) of it engages with said second rotating fixing means (12) of the storage container (9), by thus making it possible for a removal of the storage container (9) outside of the sterile vessel (19).
12. Sterile vessel (19) according to the preceding claim, characterised in that it further comprises a sterile aqueous environment.
13. Sterile vessel (19) according to the preceding claim, characterised in that the retaining portion of the container (21) presents a grooved base making it possible for a passage of liquid from the aqueous environment, both through the outlet opening (14) of the storage container (9), and through the inlet opening (15) of it.
14. Sterile vessel (19) according to one of claims 11 to 13, characterised in that, in said sinking position of the tubular body (1) in the sterile vessel (19), the barrel (7) has no contact with the vessel (19).
