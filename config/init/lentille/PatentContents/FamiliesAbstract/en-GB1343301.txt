1343301 Machining contact lenses ESSILOR INTERNATIONAL COMPAGNIE GENERALE D'OPTIQUE 19 Jan 1971 [22 Jan 1970] 2658/71 Heading B3T In a method of machining the edge of a contact lens 10 made of a flexible plastics material, the lens 10 is located, centred and clamped between two coaxial spindles 12, 17 one of which is driven to rotate the lens, one of the spindles being axially displaceable with respect to the other and wherein prior to machining the lens and its supporting members are sprayed with a jet of freezing fluid to harden the lens and to promote rigidity of the lens during the machining operation which is effected by cutting tools mounted on tool slides 20, 21. The lens is centred with respect to its axis of rotation with the spindles by way of a retractable sleeve 35 coaxial with the spindle 12, the centred lens being supported on member 42 freely rotatable on an extension 41 of the spindle 17 the member 42 carrying a support pad 45 having a contour corresponding to that of the lens. The lens may be provided with an annular rim to promote some initial rigidity to permit accurate alignment and locating of the lens, the rim being subsequently removed by a cutting tool, prior to the machining of the contour on the edge of the lens. Optical means may be provided to ensure accurate location of the lens on the axis of rotation prior to machining, the optical system being along the axis of the spindles which may be hollow. In an alternative embodiment an additional device is provided whereby the lens is "centred" by way of the above optical means and is cut to the appropriate diameter by an annular cutter 70 which is pivotable by way of a cranked arm 72 into and out of the machining axis so that machining of the contour of the lens edge can be effected as described when the annular cutter is positioned away from the spindle axis.
