The invention relates to a lens that can be implanted in the cornea for correcting vision defects, such as presbyopia. It consists of a zonal diffractive lens with phase inversion that comprises an alternation of optically active or 'full' annular areas (2) and of optically inactive or empty annular areas (3) which are all concentric. The empty annular areas (3) are filled with an optically inactive 'cement' that binds together the 'full' annular areas (2) in order to ensure the stability thereof. The cement is a hydrogel pervious to nutrients and oxygen having an optical index close to that of the cornea.
