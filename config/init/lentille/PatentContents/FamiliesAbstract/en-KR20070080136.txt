A liquid lens testing method and a testing device, and a liquid lens manufacturing method using the same are provided to simply test sticking effectiveness of a liquid lens by measuring the spreading degree of liquid flowing over from a liquid containing part in sticking a cover glass and a lens body to each other. A liquid lens testing method is composed of steps for moving a liquid lens to the set position to test the liquid lens(S20); measuring the liquid lens by using a measurement sensor moving relatively to the liquid lens(S30); judging the sticking effectiveness of the liquid lens on the basis of data measured in the measurement sensor(S40); and judging whether a normal state checking process for all liquid lenses is finished or not(S70).
