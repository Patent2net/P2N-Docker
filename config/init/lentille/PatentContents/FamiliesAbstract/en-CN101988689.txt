The invention discloses a light field light shade for a high-power LED single polycrystalline chip module street lamp, which comprises a sectorial body, wherein a flat flared inner cavity with two open ends is formed in the sectorial body; the periphery of the inner opening has a joint annular face, and an annular sleeve extends from the joint annular face for mounting a single dispersing lens; an outwards convex embedded part extends outwards from the periphery of the outer opening; and an annular baffle plate extends outwards from the outside of the outwards convex embedded part and is provided with a plurality of hollow cylinders, of which the inner openings face forward, to be connected in a plug-in manner and fixed with a plurality of pins on the periphery of the inner side of a window in the shell of the street lamp. The light field light shade is mounted on the shell of the street lamp to form rectangular light fields of different length-to-width ratios required by the regulations for street lamps directly together with a primary light source consisting of a high-power LED single polycrystalline chip module and a single lens, and is capable of making the brightness uniform,well shading light and preventing glare.
