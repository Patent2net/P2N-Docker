            "content": "[I I] An apparatus for inspecting a liquid lens comprising: a moving device for moving the liquid lens to a predetermined position to inspect the liquid lens; a measurement sensor relatively movable with respect to the liquid lens and measuring the liquid lens; and a controller for processing data measured by the measurement sensor and determining whether the liquid lens is effectively adhered. [12] The apparatus according to claim 11, further comprising a device for handling a defective liquid lens to be separated from normal liquid lenses. [13] The apparatus according to claim 11, further comprising an intermediate connection member for connecting the liquid lens to the moving device to move the liquid lens together with the moving device. [14] The apparatus according to any one of claims 11 to 13, wherein the measurement sensor is an image processor for photographing the liquid lens to obtain data thereof. [15] The apparatus according to claim 14, wherein the measurement sensor measures a spread of the liquid when a lens body and a cover glass of the liquid lens are adhered to each other. [16] The apparatus according to claim 12, wherein the defective lens handling device makes a recognition mark on a surface of the defective liquid lens. [17] The apparatus according to claim 12, wherein the defective lens handling device individually recognizes a recognition number given to each liquid lens, and stores and manages inspection data of each liquid lens. [18] The apparatus according to claim 13, wherein the intermediate connection member comprises a tray to which the liquid lens is directly fixed, and a stage on which the tray is installed. [19] The apparatus according to claim 18, further comprising a first fixing device for fixing the liquid lens to the tray, and a second fixing device for fixing the tray to the stage. [20] A method of fabricating a liquid lens, comprising: filling at least two liquids having different properties into a liquid receptacle formed in a lens body; adhering a cover glass to the lens body corresponding thereto measuring the liquid lens using a measurement sensor after adhering the cover glass to the lens body; and determining whether the cover glass is effectively adhered to the lens body on the basis of data measured by the measurement sensor. [21] The method according to claim 20, wherein measuring the liquid lens comprises measuring a spread of the liquid flowed from the liquid receptacle when the liquid lens is adhered. [22] The method according to claim 20, wherein measuring the liquid lens comprises measuring a brightness of the liquid accommodated in the liquid lens. [23] The method according to claim 20, wherein measuring the liquid lens is performed by directly measuring a space between the lens body and the cover glass. [24] The method according to any one of claims 20 to 23, further comprising supplying a sealant between the lens body and the cover glass adhered to each other.\n",
