A Fresnel lens and an LED(Light Emitting Diode) lighting device using the same are provided to secure excellent luminance uniformity, to reduce the size of the LED lighting device, and to remove a yellow ring effect generated in using a spherical lens. A Fresnel lens(50b) installed in the front side of an LED(10) emitting the light to change a path of the light emitted from the LED has an draft angle(theta) same as an emission angle(theta) of the emitted light. The LED lighting device is composed of the LED; the Fresnel lens; a fluorescent layer surrounding the LED, passing the light emitted from the LED, and containing YAG:Ce(Yttrium Aluminum Garnet:Cerium) fluorescent materials; and an LED cup reflecting the light laterally emitted from the LED, to the front side, wherein the LED is placed in the LED cup.
