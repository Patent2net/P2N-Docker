A method for machining the peripheral portion of flexible contact lenses. A flexible contact lens blank is gripped between a pair of aligned rotary spindles which are then set in rotation. The actual machining is effected by a working surface which is preferably planar and covered with an abrasive material corresponding to the type of working treatment the contact lens blank is to undergo. The working surface is brought into contact with the angular peripheral edge of the lens blank until there is deformation of the peripheral portion of the lens blank. By holding the working surface in position relative to the lens blank being worked, the faces of the blank at the periphery are automatically alternately and successively worked.
