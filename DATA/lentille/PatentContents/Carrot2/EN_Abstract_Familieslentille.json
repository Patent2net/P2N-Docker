CONSTITUTION: An implantation tissue body 20 consists of the central part 21 of the circular shape constituting the lens itself and the elastic supplying part 22. This supporting part is coupled to the central part 21 only by the single material part 24. As a result, the impartation of flexibility to the implantation tissue body and the 'folding' of this body to the max. possible extent during the introducing into the eye are made possible. Then, the incision ought to be executed to the cornea and film in order to insert the implantation tissue body to the proper point may be minimized. Further, a blind hole 25 is installed at the central part of the mounting part 24 and this hole is adapted to receive the end of a hook-shaped appliance, by which the correct positioning of the transplantation tissue body into the eye by a surgeon is made possible.\n\n",

CONSTITUTION: A surface S of a lens L consists of a visual field area VL for far sight, a visual field area VI for middle sight, and a visual field area VP for near sight. The curvature of the area VI is increased upward along a principal meridional curve MP. A curve C1 as the boundary between areas VI and VP crosses the curve MP at a point A2. Similarly, a curve C2 as the boundary between areas VI and VP crosses the curve MP at a point A2. The curvature of the curve MP starts changing at a point A3, which is a distance d1=f(A) off the point A2, in the area VI and is changed in the same direction up to a point A4, which is a distance d2=h(A) off the point A2, also in the area VP. The difference between curvatures at points A2 and A4 is denoted as \u25b5C=g(A). These functions f(A), h(A), and g(A) are reduction functions of a diopter entry value A of the lens between points A1 and A2.\n\n",
